  "description": "<p>I am a physics and math student. I mostly think about physics, math, film, academia, and philosophy. My interest in physics is in cosmology, particularly in the large scale structure of the universe. I watch films regularly, and I try to make my own films. <br> <br> I dabble with multiple languages including Latin, French, and Italian. I find trying to write down things in languages with the aid of a dictionary is very helpful in mastering the language. </p>"
