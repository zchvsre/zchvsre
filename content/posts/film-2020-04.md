## 陽光普照 | A Sun (Taiwan, 2019)

作為今年金馬獎最佳影片的得主，缺少了來自大陸的有力競爭者，《陽光普照》依然是值得一看的佳作。本片通過家庭的的三稜鏡來折射更廣闊的社會動態延續了台灣電影新浪潮的傳統（《牯嶺街少年殺人事件》，《悲情城市》，《一一》，《飲食男女》，《推手》）。如果被視為現實主義電影，鍾孟宏對色彩的風格化運用，無處不在的非劇情內音樂，以及及其戲劇化的劇情讓本片節奏更明快，觀影體驗更輕鬆。但這種對真實的妥協也讓本片對社會問題的討論缺乏說服力。舉例來講，小玉結婚和父親殺人兩個情節讓人感覺會是在電視劇裏出現的情節，阿豪在講故事出現的漫畫也更像是喜劇片會常用的手法。如果現實主義和形式主義之間一個完美的中間點，那麼本片很明顯的不在這個點上。

##  نمای نزدیک | Close-up (Iran, 1990)

This is the first Kiarostami film I've watched except the opening minutes of <em>24 Frames</em>. I like it, not because of its experimental documentary form but its subtle touches on the tenderness of a criminal. I was moved by Close-up in a similar fashion as I was moved by <em> Bicycle Thieves </em> and <em>A Brighter Summer Day</em> (interestingly also based on a real event.) –– I've lived moments close to those lived respectively by Sabzian, Enzo, and Xiao Si. These films' inclusion of mundane tidbits of the protagonists and their narratives of their crimes per se constitute an sympathetic understanding of the wrongdoers. I think there is a literature counterpart of this sympathetic inclusion: take for example <em> Season of Migration to the North</em> by Tayeb Salih, in which Mustafa Sa'eed tells the story of his crimes since his early education under British colonialism. I couldn't help but feel the complexity behind the murder he committed later, and I feel sympathetic despite there is no prompts from the author. <br>

Another point I would like to talk about is the use of flowers as props in the film. First they appeared when the driver was waiting outside of the Ahankah family, which acompanies an unusual and almost empty shot of a can rolling down the ramp. The second time flowers appears is when Makhmalbaf and Sabzian purchase them, after which is the first time we hear any music in this film then the famous bike-riding sequence. The flowers are a amazing prop is that they act like the door knob to another world, the world of unadulterated imagery, uncanny music, and reconciliation –– it's the magic wand that transforms a new-reel to a affecting film. I am trying to think up similar objects in other films, but I don't think there are any on my mind that is as effective as flowers in this film.   

## Zimna wojna | Cold War (Poland, 2018)
This is probably the shortest film I've seen in a while. However, the story is very well compressed into 86 minutes. It actually works more like an afternoon session of remembrance –– you don't quite remember slience as it happened, and there is none of it in this film. Of course the succinctness gives this film a different grain when compared to Tarkovsky or Haneke's film –– duration of shots do matter a lot in fermenting emotions. 

As in <em>Ida</em>, Paweł Pawlikowski alternates between fringe and symmetrical framing and gives music a central role, and both films end in an anticlimax –– they could be two episodes in a series. As an auteur, he seems to be highly consistent.
