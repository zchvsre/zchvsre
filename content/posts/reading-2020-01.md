## Act normal: hybrid tendencies in documentary film (Moody, 2013)
### "One shared intention of these films is their tendency to not confirm information agendas or state facts but to question, confuse and experiment, they are open forms of filmmaking... Perhaps these films respond to the need to re-engage trust of audiences with indirect truth finding exercises: journalism that does not feel like journalism, science that does not feel like science."`

In this paragraph and later in the passage, it seems Moody is arguing that the trend of "hybrid documentary" is responding to the tension between traditional documentary media and its audience in the post-truth era. The filmmakers renew their pact with the audience by revealing the form of production of their images. However, earlier Moody also suggests that these new forms of documentary filmmaking are reversions to Robert Flaherty's fictional, scripted, and dramatic early documentaries. I think these two statements contradict each other. Flaherty's films are fabrications pandering the imaginations of the Western audiences –– the trust between Flaherty and his audience are based partially on the inertia of the viewers and partially on the nascence of documentary cinema instead of filmmaker's attempt to manifest sincerity. The filmmaking of Robert Flaherty is by no means transparent and the dramatic elements in his films are not for the purpose of clarification. I think Flaherty and his followers who forge reality deserve different treatment than the filmmakers Moody lists. I might change my mind when I see more films from his list.
